# Hey, I'm Justin Carpenter  
I work as a software developer and senior teaching assistant at Codeworks here in Boise.

Much like the students we teach, I'm constantly trying to grow and improve upon my skills. I have a passion for learning new technologies and integrating them with current languages/frameworks I know.
